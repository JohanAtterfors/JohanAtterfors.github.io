## Who I am and a short history
<img align="right" width="30%" height="30%" src="/assets/images/IMG_6559.png">
I am currently a computer science and engineering student at Chalmers
Teknsika högskola in Gothenburg Sweden. In the spring of 2021 I will start
my bachelor's thesis in ecosystem simulations at the CSE department.

Before I began studying I did a winter as a ski instructor in Austria. In
November 2020 I extended  my certificate to a Landeschilehrer 1, a level 2
certificate in Austria.

I got my upper secondary qualification from Berzeliusskolan in Linköping
Sweden at a technical programme.
