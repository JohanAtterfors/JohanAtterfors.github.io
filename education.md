## Academic career so far

Here follows a comprehensive list of all passed university courses I have taken and
my grades, followed by a rounded GPA. Grade scale is shown first. Note that
grading scales cannot be directly translated between 3-4-5 and G-VG-MVG. I am
currently working on my undergrad towards a BSc in computer science and engineering and will start
my MSc in the fall of 2021\. The programme of choice is Algorithms, Languages
and Logic. (Only possible grades in Sustainable development are G and U)
