My life mostly entails physical activity, learning and spending time with the
people I love. I am an avid reader and someone who cannot give up on a
problem until it is solved. My next adventure will hopefully be a return to
my beloved alps this winter, hit me up if you want in!

Much of my time when not spent studying is spent on running and an active life.
I have been running most my life along with skiing. Some of the best times of
my life so far where spent in the mountains, both in Sweden and the alps.

If you want a powder buddy, problem solver or a running mate do not hesitate to
hit me up at mail. If you are interested please read through my resume and about
page to learn more about my career.
